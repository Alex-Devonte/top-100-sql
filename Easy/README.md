```sql
SELECT actor_id, director_id FROM actordirector GROUP BY actor_id, director_id HAVING count(*) >= 3;
```
| actor_id | director_id |
|----------|-------------|
|    1     |     1       |

## Combine Two Tables
#### Table: Person
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
```
#### Table: Address
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.
```
#### Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people: FirstName, LastName, City, State

```sql
SELECT Person.FirstName, Person.LastName, Address.City, Address.State
FROM Person
LEFT JOIN Address
    ON Person.PersonID = Address.PersonID;
```
| firstname | lastname | city | state |
|-----------|----------|------|-------|
| Allen     | Wang     |      |       |


## Rank Scores
#### Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.
```
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

+-------+---------+
| score | Rank    |
+-------+---------+
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 3.85  | 2       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.50  | 4       |
+-------+---------+
```

```sql
SELECT Score , DENSE_RANK() OVER ( ORDER BY Score DESC) AS "RANK" FROM Scores;
```
| score | RANK |
|-------|------|
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |

+------------+--------------+------------+----------+-----------+
```

#### Write an SQL query to report, How much cubic feet of volume does the inventory occupy in each warehouse.

```sql
SELECT Warehouse.name as warehouse_name, SUM(Products.Width * Products.Length * Products.Height * Warehouse.units) AS volume
FROM Warehouse
JOIN Products 
    ON Warehouse.product_id = Products.product_id 
GROUP BY warehouse_name;
```
| warehouse_name | volume |
|---------------|--------|
| LCHouse2      | 20250  |
| LCHouse1      | 12250  |
| LCHouse3      | 800    |


## Article
```
Table: Views

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| article_id    | int     |
| author_id     | int     |
| viewer_id     | int     |
| view_date     | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date. 
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.

The query result format is in the following example:

Views table:
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 3          | 4         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+

Result table:
+------+
| id   |
+------+
| 5    |
| 6    |
+------+
```

#### Write an SQL query to find all the people who viewed more than one article on the same date, sorted in ascending order by their id.

```sql
SELECT viewer_id AS id
FROM Views 
GROUP BY viewer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT article_id) > 1;
```


| id   |
|------|
| 5    |
| 6    |
